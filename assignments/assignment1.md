### Assignment 1

## DOMAINS

1. International grocery store finder. My parents are Chinese immigrants and sometimes they have trouble finding nearby Chinese grocery stores, especially right after moving. 
   It would be nice to have an app that supports many languages, is intuitive to use for older people, has filters by nationality or desired grocery, and ratings and reviews from locals.

2. College party finder. Parties are in high demand for college students, especially in the Boston / Cambridge area. I often see large groups of students milling about on the          sidewalks, unsure where to go after leaving their previous location. It would be convenient for students to be able to find party locations on a map. Users can take a picture and it will show up as a blip on the map. Other users can view the map and head to that location.

3. College parent primer guide. A lot of parents, especially International or transfer students' parents, are worried about how their child will fare on campus. All campus members like teachers, students, and faculty can write about what they do and their own experiences. Can be an informational app with multiple broad categories, then smaller sub-topics, and finally individual posts or articles. A timeline with dates would also be helpful, for MIT events or student group events. 

4. College fraternity info app. Fraternity members can register their fraternity and info, community members can leave reviews.

5. Dorm laundry visualizer. Especially useful for dorms with many laundry machines, this app can show the status of all laundry machines in the floor/dorm. Connected to each laundry machine, will have states like: Available, Washing/Drying, Occupied but not in use.

6. Project idea helper. Users can enter ideas along with their skills, and it can recommend similar completed projects or similar project ideas using AI assistance. Then it outlines the steps to complete the project as well as a long-term timeline of where the project can go after 5+ years.

7. Local skill swap / local services craigslist clone. Regional app that allows users to offer trade-specific services or skills, and other users to hire or recruit them. Can be used as a cheaper alternative to stores offering the service. Users can rate. 

8. In-depth nutrition and health tracker. Not only tracks calories or weight, but also nutritional components of food eaten, and generates AI-assisted recommendations. Has a grocery store finder that suggests both great deals on nutritious items, as well as stores that contain necessary foods.

9. DJ helper. Automatically keeps track of currently playing genre as well as current and past songs. Measures room's excitement level through volume, with user input on room size, occasion, etc. AI-assisted recommendations of next tracks, songs with smooth transitions. Recommends transition DJ deck settings between songs. 

10. Screen distance recommender. Users can input room lighting conditions and measure screen proximity to user. Then intakes users' eyesight settings, and dynamically recommends a distance for the screen to be at to minimize harm to eyesight. Notifies users how to move the screen to optimize distance, such as: move screen 2m away, closer. 

## Problems

# International grocery store finder

1. Many immigrant or older parents, such as mine, have difficulty using map apps like Google maps, often because they are too complex or offer too many options and give them availability paralysis. My parents often ask me to find local stores for them that have a specific ingredient they want. The language barrier in many apps makes them unappealing to non-English speakers, even changing languages on the phone itself is hard. I chose this problem because it is an extremely authentic need that I know immigrant and older families with first-generation college students have. It is under-developed by apps like Google Maps and Yelp. 

2. My parents communicate with their friends and colleagues and get recommendations that way. Possibly partly because of their difficulty using apps like Google Maps and Yelp, they primarily trust word of mouth. Being unable to read the reviews on Yelp also contributes to why it is difficult for non-English speakers to use recommendation apps. Excluded because a well-functioning multilingual app can offer similar benefits as word of mouth, especially if people they know use the app. 

3. There are times when Google Maps or any recommender app misleads the user by being too general. A convenience store with "grocery" in the name often does not have the same volume or variety of items as an actual grocery store. For people looking for ethnic groceries or specific products, they may not know if the store is right for them until they visit. Excluded because this can usually be solved if the location in the app has clear pictures along with it that can help inform the user on whether the store is right for them.

# College Party Finder

1. One big problem with having a fun night out at campus parties is that no one really thinks about what to do right after. Every partygoer has a ton of fun inside the party, then once they leave or the party ends, there's a lot of indecision and downtime before the group comes up with a new destination. Many people just wander in the area, roaming towards other crowds on the block or loud music. Chosen because this is a very common issue that affects almost everyone at some point during their night. It is optimal for party-goers who want minimal downtime. 

2. Sometimes you can show up to a party just to find that it is overcrowded with no one getting inside, or that it had been shut down thirty minutes ago. This puts a dampener on your night's plan and now you have to scramble to come up with a new fun destination. This is a real problem but it is very difficult to address because the flow of people changes so often. It would require constant updates, and possibly moderation to stop false reports. 

3. A lot of parties have bad attendance because of low exposure. These parties are often very fun, but suffer from not enough people. It would be great if these parties could be elevated into larger events with people coming in from near and far. Excluded because this somewhat overlaps with the chosen problem. Can be addressed with the same party-discovery feature. 

# College parent primer guide

1. A lot of colleges use college-specific language, slang, or acronyms that could be difficult for a newcomer, especially a parent, to understand. This leaves students and parents confused and unable to make their college experience as enriching as it could be with more knowledge. Chosen because it is a very real problem that I have personal experience with. The knowledge required to understand or read some emails makes it unintuitive for parents who aren't familiar with the college's culture. 

2. Colleges have lots of resources dedicated to helping new students and parents, but they are often spread out over dozens of websites, each belonging to a certain organization. If this info were centralized, it would be a lot more convenient for people to learn about the college. Not selected because the issue is difficult to solve fully, and centralizing most but not all information could lead to that information being obscured even more. 

3. Lots of college resources are often written by the administration, teachers, or even other parents. The student perspective is arguably the most vital, because these parents are concerned about what their students will go through. Excluded because user-generated content may require moderation, and quality is not guaranteed. It is an important problem, but may require a lot of structure and moderation to work safely. 

## Stakeholders

# International grocery store finder

Immigrant shoppers / older adults (primary user group interacting with the app); family of immigrant shoppers (younger relatives who may or may not be users, the ones running the errands); International / ethnic grocery store owners (users promoting their store on the app, also a primary user). Immigrant shoppers are the most directly affected by the problem, it is difficult to use apps that are designed for English speakers, or apps that are too complex. Younger family members often have the burden of assisting immigrant shopper parents with finding stores, the app could reduce that burden on them. The app helps promote up-and-coming and smaller international store owners. 

# College Party Finder

College students (primary user interacting with the app); party hosts (primary users looking to promote their event and attract users looking for a party); local community members (possibly not directly using the app, but affected by parties happening as well as crowds outside). College students are often disappointed or confused when first heading to a party or leaving one, leading to wasted time and safety concerns from neighbors. Party hosts benefit from better crowd control and timing if students know their options and other places to go if the party is full. Neighbors benefit from knowing when parties will happen, as well as smaller crowds outside their door if a party is full or gets shut down. 

# College parent primer guide

College student parents (primary user interacting with the app); college students (non-users who are affected by users using the app); university groups or administration (primary app users who post information into the app for parents). Parents may misinterpret what emails or resources are saying because of unfamiliar slang or academic terms. College students are often the parents' source of information, less burden on them with the app. University groups are given a location to dump information into, increases parent engagement without much effort.
